#+title: Exercism: Python track

I've been using Python to some extent since Mark Lutz's [[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-3rd/9780596513986/][Learning Python (3rd
ed.)]]. At the time, it was a godsend compared to C++ and MATLAB, but I've since
learned to tame the parentheses of Lisp and appreciate a stronger typing
system. That said, it's easy to write short scripts, and the numerical analysis
and visualization tools would be difficult for me to give up.

These exercises are my attempt to practice my Python-fu and ensure I'm capable
of taking advantage of newer language features like type annotations and
structural pattern matching.
